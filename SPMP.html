<h2 id="Overview">1. Overview</h2>
<h3 id="Project_Overview">1.1 Project Overview</h3>
<p>
Bookshelf is a web-based application that allows users to track and store the status of their collection of media content.
</p>
<h3 id="Audience">1.2 Audience</h3>
<p>
Bookshelf is for individuals who desire an efficient way to track the neverending backlog of entertainment content. Users will be able to receive recommendations on books or television shows they are interested in. They will also be able to see the media content that their friends are interested in. This platform allows the user to explore new sections or topics of interest that they might not know anything about as well as stay updated with media they are involved in already.
</p>
<h3 id="Scope">1.3 Scope</h3>
<p>
The scope of this project will be two-fold: act as a content-management system, and a recommendation system. The priority objective is to offer a seamless way to organize a collection of media, followed closely with the objective of discovering new and curated content for the user.
</p>
<h3 id="Assumptions_and_Constraints">1.4 Assumptions and Constraints</h3>
<p>
Bookshelf will focus on targeting mobile device users. Using modern web technologies with a mobile first design will allow for cross platform support and faster development while retaining user trust and expectations for native application patterns.

<h3 id="Evolution">1.6 Evolution of the Plan</h3>
<p>
The workflow pattern for maintaining the SPMP document will follow an integration branching flow with respect to the deliverable deadlines. 
</p>
<p>
The single source of truth for the SPMP will be stored on a Google Document. All changes after the initial creation will be tracked in the “Authored by” changelog and follow the format of `<name> [YYYY-MM-DD]: <description of changes>`.
</p>
<p>
On every release (when a deliverable is completed), the changelog will reflect that a snapshot has been created with `<name> [YYYY-MM-DD]: snapshot-<semver numbering> for <name of deliverable>`. The snapshot of the SPMP will live in the project’s Git repository.
